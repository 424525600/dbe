   <!--DESCRIPTION-->
	<!--In this example we have the original drawing where we have created 9 region using polylines with hatch properteis fill mode solid with transparency 0 
      so we can not see the polylines and the hatches.Also we have set tooltip in each of these hatches in order to display it in the whole room.
      After these we created a polyline with transparency 70 and linetype DASHEDO which will be the route for the image.
      We get the length of this polyline and using vdcanvas.MeasureCurve we get all the points of every 100 drawing units and we place the image on each point.
      The last thing we do is to place also a text with text value the tolltip of the drawing and we place it under the image.-->
